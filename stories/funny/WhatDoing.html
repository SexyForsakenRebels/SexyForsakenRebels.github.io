    <p>6/1/2018 - So... I had an interesting experience today.  I queued for my daily dungeon, which came up Cragmire Crypts.  And I got paired with a couple of what you would call lite-weight characters. So I say to myself, "Ok... I'll try to go slow for these guys."  So I start running the dungeon by just cursing the mobs... and letting my soul puppet and companion destroy them for me (and them).</p>
    <p>So... anyways... so then random partner says:
    <img src="images/whatdoing1.jpg" /> SW?!?  WHAT DOING?!  :) 
    </p>
    <p>So... I'm like... ok, fine.  I run the dungeon... and then I take a look at my critic:<br /> <img src="images/whatdoing2.jpg" /></p>
    <p>and then I look at the 2nd tab: <br /><img src="images/whatdoing3.jpg" /><br /> and it says level 0.  </p>
    <p>I guess I'm a bit in awe, actually.  Since I can't even see anyone else until I hit at least level 5 in this game.  :)  Mostly, I recon those are people preparing PVP characters.  ;)</p>
