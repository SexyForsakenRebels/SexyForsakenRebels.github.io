    <p>So here, we will start building out pages and links to help our new guild members get up to speed.</p>

    <p><b><u>Tools</u></b></p>
    <p>Attention to detail really pays off in the field, so here are a few tools to help you scout for gear, or at least get a better idea of where your current gear fits into the grand scheme of things. :)</p>
    <p><table><tr><th class="menuCell"><a href="insigniaBonus/">Mount Insignia Bonus Tool</a></th></tr></table>This tool will help you track down the right mount to get the insignia bonuses you would like to have (at the cheapest price), or help you to restack bonuses on mounts you already have.</p>
    <p><table><tr><th class="menuCell"><a href="rings/">Rings Tool</a></th></tr></table>This tool lets you browse around for rings, filtering by equip bonus and slot types.</p>
    <p><table><tr><th class="menuCell"><a href="companions/">Companions Tool</a></th></tr></table>This tool lets you browse around for companions, filtering by active bonus, slot types and companion type.</p>
