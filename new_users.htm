    In my travels around the Sword Coast, it has been a fairly common
    occurrence, whether on the street, within our Alliance, or even
    sometimes within our own guild, that I will encounter a new player
    to Neverwinter who exhibits the traits and behaviors of someone
    being totally lost and overwhelmed with the game.&nbsp; This is
    frequently accompanied with phrases like "can you help me level?"...
    to which I will start talking about enchantments, and they will look
    at me like "whu?".&nbsp; More than once, I have taken the time to
    transmit the information I'm about to share here through chat window
    with players, and have often thought "ya know, I really need to
    write this down", because I had many of the same problems when I was
    first starting out.<br>
    <br>
    So... here I am (finally).<br>

    <br>
    <h3><a name="intro"></a><b>The Intro</b></h3>
    The first point to make here, is that the game is designed to carry
    you through the levelling process via the Quest line. This is
    intentional, and not such a bad deal, so just go with it.&nbsp; As a
    brand new account, there really are no shortcuts.&nbsp; Once you've
    done it once, possibilities will open up to you for speeding up the
    development of additional characters.&nbsp; But in the beginning,
    follow the quest line, and pay attention to the game mechanics they
    are trying to teach you.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    The intro quest line (the quests you must complete before you can
    interact with other users in the game) will take you to around Level
    6, and does a pretty good job of giving you a chance to learn some
    of the basic mechanics of your character.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><a name="money"></a><b>Money</b></h3>
    That being said, some people will tell you that the quest line is
    also designed to give you all of the gear you will need.&nbsp;
    True... and false.&nbsp; Let me just tell it to you straight:&nbsp;
    in this game, what you are going to need... is money.&nbsp; In
    Neverwinter, there are MANY forms of currency, but your primary
    currency will be something called Astral Diamonds (commonly referred
    to as AD).&nbsp; In the beginning, your primary method of earning AD
    is found here:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/newUsers/2019-06-29%2022_51_34-GameClient.png"
      alt="" class="full" width="1445" height="919"><br>
    <br>
    the Random: Leveling Queue.&nbsp; You pull up this screen by <b>pressing





      the K key</b>, and ability to queue will start being available to
    you once you hit Level 10, which is easy to reach, again, if you
    just follow the questline from Sgt. Knox.&nbsp; The reward for
    queuing and running this each day is 9,000 astral diamonds.&nbsp;
    Running this will just become part of your daily routine.&nbsp; The
    dungeons are made up of a random group of 5 people, and usually go
    quite fast.&nbsp; You are paid in rough astral diamonds, which must
    then be refined.&nbsp; You can do this by access your currency
    window, by <b>pressing the I key </b>to pull up your inventory,
    and then clicking on the currency tab.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/newUsers/2019-06-29%2023_05_29-GameClient.png"
      alt="" class="full" width="1445" height="919"><br>
    <br>
    Then just click on the Refine button.&nbsp;&nbsp; The game puts a
    cap you probably won't have to worry about hitting for a long time
    of 100,000 rough astral diamonds refined into the spendable astral
    diamonds per day.&nbsp; Also, if you don't manually refine your
    rough AD, the game will do it for you every night (up to the daily
    max).&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    But once you have some money to spend, then what?<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><a name="auctionhouse"></a><b>The Auction House</b></h3>
    Affectionally referred to, in chat, as AH, the Auction House is
    where users buy and sell gear and items with each other.&nbsp; You
    access the Auction House by clicking on this icon:<br>
    <br>
    <img
      src="images/newUsers/2019-06-29%2023_00_41-GameClient-auction.png"
      alt="" width="224" height="76"><br>
    <br>
    in the toolbar at the top of your screen.&nbsp; The biggest deal
    about the auction house is learning how to search it.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/newUsers/2019-06-29%2023_11_22-GameClient.png"
      alt="" class="full" width="1445" height="919"><br>
    <br>
    and probably the first thing you'll use it to search for is gear.<br>
    <br>
    I'm just gonna use one example on this page, but the same principle
    applies to all of the equipment types, and really everything.&nbsp;
    So let's pretend that I just hit level 20, and I wanted to go see
    what kind of options just opened up for me in the way of
    armor.&nbsp; I would go to the auction house, click on Armor over on
    the left, then click the checkbox "Usable by me", and then I would
    add a level filter.&nbsp; The level filter just means, what level
    does the user have to be to use the gear.&nbsp; When I click on
    "Usable By Me", it automatically sets the highest level as mine,
    20... but then to avoid all of the lower level junk, I put 15 into
    the first box.&nbsp; So this means, show me all of the gear that
    requires user to be levels 15 - 20.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/newUsers/2019-06-29%2022_02_17-GameClient.png"
      alt="" class="full" width="1445" height="919"><br>
    <br>
    First... notice the price of things.&nbsp; In 1 dungeon run, I made
    9000 AD... the things here are starting at 60.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Click
    on the right paging arrow to review the list and look for your upper
    tolerance on price.&nbsp; Don't spend too much.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/newUsers/2019-06-29%2022_03_26-GameClient.png"
      alt="" class="full" width="1445" height="919"><br>
    <br>
    I would personally recommend setting a cap of no more than 2000 per
    purchase while you are levelling.&nbsp; Once you find the highest
    item you are willing to pay for, then just look for the cheapest
    buyout price for that particular item and pull the trigger.<br>
    <br>
    In this case here, the quest line had me wearing <br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/newUsers/2019-06-29%2023_20_57-GameClient.png"
      alt="" class="full" width="1445" height="919"><br>
    <br>
    the Scale Armor of Assualt.&nbsp; Now... I certainly could have
    soldiered on with this armor, I'm sure, and eventually got something
    better in the quest line... or... for 1300 AD in the auction house,
    I was able to pick up the Iron Hauberk +1, which gives me a 40 point
    defense boost over the quest line, a 100 point power boost, and a
    400 hit point boost.&nbsp; Plus, it's an additional 40 points in
    stat bonuses (the numbers under the line).&nbsp; Paying attention to
    little details like this is a great habit to get into... and usually
    you can repeat this pattern of levelling up gear all the way to end
    game.&nbsp; The baseline Undermountain gear, for example, is dirt
    cheap and typically better than your end gear from the previous
    mod.&nbsp; Once you've pulled the trigger on buying something
    through the auction house, the item you bought is then sent to your
    mailbox, so you will need to familiar yourself with where those
    mailboxes are.&nbsp; There is a convenient one looked just as you
    walk into Protector's Enclave.<br>
    <br>
    One last point here is, if things seem above your price comfort
    level:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/newUsers/2019-06-30%2000_30_34-GameClient.png"
      alt="" class="full" width="1445" height="919"><br>
    <br>
    then just start taping down the minimum item level <br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/newUsers/2019-06-30%2000_33_59-GameClient.png"
      alt="" class="full" width="1445" height="919"><br>
    <br>
    In this particular case, the Adventurer's Sword Knot is what I
    currently have, I will probably go ahead and spend the extra and go
    over my budget to upgrade.&nbsp; It's a judgement call, but always
    spend as little as possible to start with.&nbsp; There are plenty of
    other things you will need to spend AD on.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><a name="appearance"></a><b>Appearance</b></h3>
    So... now that you know how to go about earning money and buying new
    gear, let's stop here very briefly just to talk about
    appearance.&nbsp; As you move through the game, you will undoubtedly
    run across characters that have some very interesting looking
    costumes.&nbsp; Most of the time, these are acheived with a process
    called Transmuting.&nbsp; Basically what this means is that you can
    take a peice of gear, and you can make it appear to be a different
    peice of gear, while not changing any of it's bonus
    attributes.&nbsp; It's strictly an appearance thing, but I
    personally think this is an important part of the game.&nbsp; To do
    this, simple click on a peice of gear, and select "Change
    Appearance".<br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/newUsers/2019-06-29%2023_30_04-GameClient.png"
      alt="" class="full" width="1445" height="919"><br>
    <br>
    when the window comes up, you'll then have a drop that you use to
    choose which peice of equipment you want it to look like:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/newUsers/2019-06-29%2023_30_28-GameClient.png"
      alt="" class="full" width="1445" height="919"><br>
    <br>
    in this case, I'm going to change the appearance of my Scale Armor
    of Assault so that it looks like Marauders Garb.&nbsp; The stats of
    Scale Armor of Assult will not change, just it's appearance.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/newUsers/2019-06-29%2023_30_44-GameClient.png"
      alt="" class="full" width="1445" height="919"><br>
    <br>
    for a small fee, of course.&nbsp; In this case, it's 14 AD.&nbsp;
    This price increases as the level of the items goes up, so by the
    time you hit end game, your transmutes will cost closer to 8000 AD,
    not a huge sum for you by that time.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><a name="enchantments"></a><b>Enchantments</b></h3>
    So did you notice, in my previous screenshot, where some of the gear
    looked like it had a little checkbox on it?<br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/newUsers/Slots.jpg" alt="" width="93" height="51"><br>
    <br>
    Those boxes are enchantment slots... and enchantments in this game
    are a HUGE deal.&nbsp; Enchantments are another way of adding stats
    to your character.&nbsp; They can be attached to gear, but more
    importantly, they can be removed from that gear to (at a price in
    gold), so that as you upgrade gear, you can collect and keep your
    same enchantments.&nbsp; This is because there is an entire levelly
    process just for enchantments.&nbsp; In the beginning, I wouldn't
    worry about that part.&nbsp; We acquire our enchantments the same
    way we acquired our cool new gear, through the Auction House.&nbsp;
    Which enchantments you buy is a process you will need to work
    through, to be sure.&nbsp; Balancing your stats is a topic I won't
    try to cover in detail on this page.&nbsp; Just know that you have 3
    types of enchantment slots:&nbsp; Offensive slots, Defensive slots,
    and Utility slots.&nbsp; Each type of enchantment will give
    different stats depending on which of these slots it is placed
    into.&nbsp; For the purpose of this guide, for new players I am
    recommend that you use <br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/newUsers/2019-06-29%2020_24_21-GameClient.png"
      alt="" class="full" width="1445" height="919"><br>
    <br>
    Radiant Enchantments for your Offensive slots (gives a boost to
    Power)....<br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/newUsers/2019-06-29%2023_57_42-GameClient.png"
      alt="" class="full" width="1445" height="919"><br>
    <br>
    Azure Enchantments for your defensive slots (this gives a Defense
    boost)... and for the utility slots, those aren't nearly as
    important.&nbsp; You will end up with a total of 4 utility slots you
    will need to fill.&nbsp; In my case, I like to use <br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/newUsers/2019-06-29%2023_58_06-GameClient.png"
      alt="" class="full" width="1445" height="919"><br>
    <br>
    Wicked Enchantments for the utility slots, since that will give me a
    10% increase on incoming healing plus a gold bonus.&nbsp; Having
    gold is a very important part of the game too.&nbsp; Many things
    require gold, including the ability to remove enchantments from your
    gear, so the more you can get there, the better.&nbsp; With 4 Wicked
    Enchantments, I'll get about a 50% boost in my gold production.<br>
    <br>
    One thing you will notice with Enchantments is that, as of MOD 16,
    Undermountain, the baseline enchantment is rank 8, so don't even
    bother refining anything lower than that unless it is specifically
    to finish a quest.&nbsp; Rank 8s sell for around 1000 AD in the
    AH.&nbsp; <br>
